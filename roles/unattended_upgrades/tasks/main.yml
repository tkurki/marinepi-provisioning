# This role enables daily check for updated packages and installs them automatically.
# By default the server reboots if any installed package requires it (e.g. kernel update).
# To prevent that, set "unattended_upgrades_allow_reboot: false".
#
# NOTE: By default only security updates are automatically installed - not all packages!
