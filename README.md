MarinePi
========

[Ansible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)) scripts to setup a Raspberry Pi for boat use, providing access to various data sources on board both via wired and wireless connections. Features include:
- [Signal K](http://signalk.org/) [node server](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) with NMEA0183 and NMEA 2000 support
- wifi hotspot
- (marina) wifi access with routing
- 3/4G Internet connectivity with Huawei e3372
- VPN access
- various dynamic dns providers (inadyn, Route 53)
- read-only root partition

Usage
=====

1. [Install Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) on your computer and verify that it works
    - ansible --version
    - note: on MacOS Ansible might not be added to your PATH in bash_profile, see [2nd answer in this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35898734/pip-installs-packages-successfully-but-executables-not-found-from-command-line/35899029) on how to fixed that.
1. Install Raspberry OS Lite on an SD-card with your local computer.
    - Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and install the OS (the tool will download the latest image)
    - Alternatively you can download the image yourself and write this to the SD-card with a tool like [Belena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) or directly from the command line with the following commands:
        ```
        diskutil list
        diskutil unmountDisk /dev/<disk#>
        sudo dd bs=1m if=<your image file>.img of=/dev/<disk#>
        ```
1. [Enable SSH](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/) while the SD-Card is still in the computer.
    - Windows: create an empty file `ssh` on the SD-card (which now has the volume label 'boot)
    - Linux/MacOS: create the empty file with this command: `touch /Volumes/boot/ssh`
    - Optionally, configure the Raspberry Pi to [connect to your Wifi network](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) (otherwise you have to connect through Ethernet)
        - Create a file `wpa_supplicants.conf` on the SD-card with the following content:
        ```
        ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
        update_config=1
        country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

        network={
        ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
        psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
        }
       ```
1. Insert SD-card in the Raspberry Pi and test the network connection.
    - ssh into your Pi with [standard credentials](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/usage/users.md) (username=pi, password=raspberry):
            `ssh <ip> -l pi`
1. Clone this git repository on your computer
    - 'git clone https://github.com/tkurki/marinepi-provisioning.git '
    - 'cd marinepi-provisioning'
1. Run `./firstrun.sh` from your computer, for the initial setup of your Raspberry Pi.
    - This script will:
        - copy over your [ssh key](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) for secure passwordles access from your computer.
        - change the default password for user `pi` (which is `raspberry`)  
        You will be asked for a new password, be aware that characters like '@' seem to crash the process
        - expand the filesystem
    - The script assumes that your Raspberry Pi is configured with the standard hostname `raspberrypi.local`. If you want to use its IP address, or another hostname use: `./firstrun.sh <ip-of-your-raspi>` ([find out the IP address](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md)).
    - Known problems:
        - MacOS users might see an error because 'sshpass' is not installed by default. See [answer in this thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32255660/how-to-install-sshpass-on-mac) on how to install sshpass (first install XCode and than the XCode command line utilities)
  
1. Create a copy of `playbooks/example-boat.yml` and edit the settings to match your environment such as the hostname, wifi and hotspot settings, etc.
1. Run `./provision.sh <ip-of-your-raspi> playbooks/example-boat.yml` to provision the software & configurations for the roles in example-boat.yml.
    - Known problems: 
        - After a automated reboot the script might not continue or it presents an 'unreachable' error. After giving it some time and verifying that the connection to the Raspberry Pi, just restart the provisioning process. The process will continue where it has stopped.  
        - An error on installing pysk, see issues on github repo for a solution
    - When the process is finished your Raspberry Pi is ready.  
    Configure signalk through the browser: http://raspberrypi:3000/ or http://raspberrypi/ (log in at the top right and change default userid `pi` and password `password`).
When you are done with the configuration save .signalk/defaults.json, security.json and settings.json. You can use these in a next provisioning process.

Roles
=====
You define what features you want to provision by adding roles to your playbook.

signalk-npm 
-------
Installs the Signal K Node server. Uses `node` and `node-app` roles to install Node.js and run under systemd.

hotspot
-------
Installs and configures the software needed for the Pi to act as a wifi hotspot. Override variables:
```
hotspot_ssid: MarinePi
hotspot_channel: 11
hotspot_passphrase: NavigareNecesseEst
hotspot_interface: wlan0
```

canboat
-------
Installs canboat utilities to interface with the NMEA 2000 network.

route53-ddns
------------
Installs a cron script that periodically checks your external IP address and updates [Amazon's Route 53 name server information to act as dynamic DNS setup](https://willwarren.com/2014/07/03/roll-dynamic-dns-service-using-amazon-route53/). Installs Amazon's command line tools as a dependency.

For minimal priviledges you should create a limited AWS identity for use with this profile and attach the policy `AmazonRoute53FullAccess`. In your own playbook define variables
```
aws_access_key_id: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
aws_secret_access_key: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
```
with the information for this limited identity.

wificlient
----------
Installs and configures the software the Pi needs to act as a wifi client. Override variables:
```
wificlient_interface: wlan1
wificlient_networks:
  - ssid: defaultssid
    psk: defaultpassphrase
    priority: 1
    scan_ssid: 0
```
You can add multiple networks by repeating the last four lines, if needed.

pysk
----
Installs the pysk console client on the Pi. See: https://github.com/ph1l/pysk

grafana
-------
Installs grafana. Override variables:
```
grafana_admin_password: admin
grafana_secret: SW2YcwTIb9zpOOhoPsMm
grafana_port: 3000
```
